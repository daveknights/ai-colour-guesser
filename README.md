# colour-guesser
R & D exercise exploring the basics of machine learning. This app uses a device camera to take a photo of an object and guess it's colour.<br>
Color Thief is used to get the dominant colour of the photo captured - https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/.<br>
Brain.js is used to guess the colour - https://brain.js.org/
